; Note: From Asterisk 12 - All parking lot configuration is now done in res_parking.conf

[general]
;transferdigittimeout => 3      ; Number of seconds to wait between digits when transferring a call
                                ; (default is 3 seconds)
;xfersound = beep               ; to indicate an attended transfer is complete
;xferfailsound = beeperr        ; to indicate a failed transfer
;pickupexten = *8               ; Configure the pickup extension. (default is *8)
;pickupsound = beep             ; to indicate a successful pickup (default: no sound)
;pickupfailsound = beeperr      ; to indicate that the pickup failed (default: no sound)
;featuredigittimeout = 1000     ; Max time (ms) between digits for
                                ; feature activation  (default is 1000 ms)
;recordingfailsound = beeperr   ; indicates that a one-touch monitor or one-touch mixmonitor feature failed
                                ; to be applied to the call. (default: no sound)
;atxfernoanswertimeout = 15     ; Timeout for answer on attended transfer default is 15 seconds.
;atxferdropcall = no            ; If someone does an attended transfer, then hangs up before the transfer
                                ; target answers, then by default, the system will try to call back the
                                ; person that did the transfer.  If this is set to "yes", the ringing
                                ; transfer target is immediately transferred to the transferee.
;atxferloopdelay = 10           ; Number of seconds to sleep between retries (if atxferdropcall = no)
;atxfercallbackretries = 2      ; Number of times to attempt to send the call back to the transferer.
                                ; By default, this is 2.
;transferdialattempts = 3       ; Number of times that a transferer may attempt to dial an extension before
                                ; being kicked back to the original call.
;transferretrysound = "beep"    ; Sound to play when a transferer fails to dial a valid extension.
;transferinvalidsound = "beeperr" ; Sound to play when a transferer fails to dial a valid extension and is out of retries.
;atxferabort = *1               ; cancel the attended transfer
;atxfercomplete = *2            ; complete the attended transfer, dropping out of the call
;atxferthreeway = *3            ; complete the attended transfer, but stay in the call. This will turn the call into a multi-party bridge
;atxferswap = *4                ; swap to the other party. Once an attended transfer has begun, this options may be used multiple times

; Note that the DTMF features listed below only work when two channels have answered and are bridged together.
; They can not be used while the remote party is ringing or in progress. If you require this feature you can use
; chan_local in combination with Answer to accomplish it.
